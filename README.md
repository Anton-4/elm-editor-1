# A Pure Elm Text Editor

This package offers a pure Elm text editor.
It relies heavily on prior work of 
Martin Janiczek and Sidney Nemzer.  It is a pleasure
to acknowledge their work.

There will be real documentation at some point.  For now, 
if you want to use this editor package the best way is to
see how it is used in the demo app.
