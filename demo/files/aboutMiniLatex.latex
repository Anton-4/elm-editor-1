You are looking at demo of an editor coupled 
to on-the-fly compilers for Markdown+Math and 
MiniLaTeX.  The first is a version of Markdown 
that can handle equations written in TeX.  The 
second is a subset of LaTeX.  As you can see 
from looking at this source, no ceremony with 

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{document}

...

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

is needed.  Just start typing what you want to 
say and watch it being rendered in real time in
the window on the right. To produce a 
stand-alone, stand-alone, standard LaTeX file, 
press the \strong{Export} button below. As an 
example, compare what you see when you push 
the XXX button below with the 
\href{http://jxxcarlson.s3.amazonaws.com/anharmonicOscillator.pdf}{PDF version}
obtained by exporting the the doument and 
running \code{pdflatex} on it.
