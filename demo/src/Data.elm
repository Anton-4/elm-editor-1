# Markdown Demo

The Markdown in this window is rendered using the Elm package
[jxxcarlson/elm-markdown](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/elm-markdown). Below we illustrate some typical Markdown
elements: images, links, headings, etc.

Text styles: **bold** *italic* ~~strike it out~~



## Code

He said that `a := 0` is an initialization
statement.

```python
# Partial sum of the harmonic series:

sum = 0
for n in range(1..100):
  sum = sum + 1.0/n
sum
```

## Verbatim and Tables (Extensions)

A verbatim block begins and ends
with four tick marks. It is just
like a code block, except that there is no
syntax highlighting.  Verbatim blocks
are an extension of normal Markdown.

````
Verbatim text has many uses:

   Element    |    Z
   --------------------
   Altium     |    4/5
   Brazilium  |    7/5
   Certium    |    9/5
````

But better is to use Markdown tables:

|  Element  | Symbol |  Z | A |
| Hydrogen  | H      |  1 | 1.008   |
| Helium    | He     |  2 |  4.0026 |
| Lithium   | Li     |  3 |  6.94   |
| Beryllium | Be     |  4 |  9.0122 |
| Boron     | B      |  5 | 10.81   |
| Carbon    | C      |  6 | 12.011  |
| Nitrogen  | N      |  7 | 14.007  |
| Oxygen    | O      |  8 | 15.999  |
| Flourine  | F      |  9 | 18.998  |
| Neon      | Ne     | 10 | 20.180  |


## Lists

Indent by four spaces for each level.  List items
are separated by blank lines.

- Solids

    - Iron *(metal)*

        - Iron disulfide (Pyrite): $FeS_2$, crystalline

        - Iron(II) sulfed $FeS$, not stable, amorphous

    - Selenium *(use for solar cells)*

- Liquids

    - Alcohol *(careful!)*

    - Water *(Ok to drink)*


## Quotations


Quotations are offset:

> Four score and seven years ago our
fathers brought forth on this continent,
a new nation, conceived in Liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

> Now we are engaged in a great c
ivil war, testing whether that
nation, or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met o
In a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate a portion
of that field, as a final resting
place for those who here gave their
lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this.

> But, in a larger sense, we can not
dedicate — we can not consecrate —
we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here,
have consecrated it, far above our poor
power to add or detract. The world will
little note, nor long remember what we say
here, but it can never forget what they d
id here. It is for us the living, rather,
to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus
far so nobly advanced. It is rather for
us to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before us—that from these
honored dead we take increased devotion
to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion—that we
here highly resolve that these dead
shall not have died in vain—that
this nation, under God, shall have
a new birth of freedom—and that
government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish
from the earth.

— Abraham Lincoln, *Gettysbug Address*

## Poetry (Extension)

Poetry blocks, an extension of normal Markdown,
 begin with ">>"; line endings are respected.

>> Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

>> Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!


Etcetera!

# Propagation and Evolution


## The propagator

Consider a wave function $\\psi(x,t)$.
If we fix $t$ and let $x$ vary, the
result is an element $\\psi(t)$ of
$L^2(R)$ or, more generally
$L^2(\\text{configuration space})$.
Thus the evolution of our system in
time is given by a function
$t \\mapsto \\psi(t)$.  The dynamics
of this path in Hilbert space is
governed by an ordinary differential
equation ,

$$
i\\hbar\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = H\\phi,
$$

Now consider bases of orthogonal
normalized states
$\\{\\; \\psi_k(t_1)\\;\\}$ and
$\\{\\; \\psi_k(t_0) \\; \\}$
at times $t_1$ and $t_0$,
with $t_1 > t_0$. There is a unique linear
transformation $U(t_1,t_0)$
such that
$\\psi_k(t_1) = U(t_1,t_0)\\psi_k(t_0)$
for all $k$.
It must be unitary because the bases
are orthonormal.
This family of transformations is
called the \\term{propagator}.
The propagator satisfies various
identities, e.g., the composition law

$$
U(t_2, t_0) = U(t_2, t_1)U(t_1, t_0)
$$

as well as $U(t,t) = 1$,
$U(t_1,t_2) = U(t_2,t_1)^{-1}$.

Let us write $U(t) = U(t,0)$ for
convenience, and let us suppose given
states $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.
The probability that the system finds
itself in state $\\beta$ after time $t$
is given by the matrix element

$$
\\bra \\beta U(t)  \\ket \\alpha
$$

This is just the kind of information
we need for comparison with experiment.

The propagator, like the family of state
vectors $\\psi(t)$, satisfies a differential
equation -- essentially a Schroedinger equation
for operators. To find it, differentiate the
equation $\\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi(0)$ to obtain

$$
i\\hbar \\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = i\\hbar \\frac{dU}{dt}\\psi(0)
$$

Substitute (C) to obtain

$$
i\\hbar \\frac{dU}{dt}\\psi(0)  = H\\psi(t)
$$

Applying $\\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi(0)$ again, we find that

$$
i\\hbar \\frac{dU}{dt}\\psi(0) = HU\\psi(0)
$$

If this is to hold for arbitrary $\\psi(0)$, then

$$
\\frac{dU}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}HU
$$

If $H$ does not depend on time, the preceding
ODE has an immediate solution, namely


$$
U(t) = e^{-i(t/\\hbar) H}
$$

Think of $H$ as a big matrix, and of the expression
on the right as a big matrix exponential.


## Notes on the free-particle propagator

Below are graphs of the real part of the
free-particle propagator for time
$t = 1, 2, 4,16$.
